LangChain simplifies the initial setup, but there is still work needed to bring the performance of prompts, chains and agents up the level where they are reliable enough to be used in production.Over the past two months, we at LangChain have been building and using LangSmith with the goal of bridging this gap. This is our tactical user guide to outline effective ways to use LangSmith and maximize its benefits.On by default\\u200bAt LangChain, all of us have LangSmith’s tracing running in the background by default. On the Python side, this is achieved by setting environment variables, which we establish whenever we launch a virtual environment or open our bash shell and leave them set. The same principle applies to most JavaScript environments through process.env1.The benefit here is that all calls to LLMs, chains, agents, tools, and retrievers are logged to LangSmith. Around 90% of the time we don’t even look at the traces, but the 10% of the time that we do… it’s so helpful. We can use LangSmith to debug:An unexpected end resultWhy an agent is loopingWhy a chain was slower than expectedHow many tokens an agent usedDebugging\\u200bDebugging LLMs, chains, and agents can be tough. LangSmith helps solve the following pain points:What was the exact input to the LLM?\\u200bLLM calls are often tricky and non-deterministic. The inputs/outputs may seem straightforward, given they are technically string → string (or chat messages → chat message), but this can be misleading as the input string is usually constructed from a combination of user input and auxiliary functions.Most inputs to an LLM call are a combination of some type of fixed template along with input variables. These input variables could come directly from user input or from an auxiliary function (like retrieval). By the time these input variables go into the LLM they will have been converted to a string format, but often times they are not naturally represented as a string (they could be a list, or a Document object). Therefore, it is important to have visibility into what exactly the final string going into the LLM is. This has helped us debug bugs in formatting logic, unexpected transformations to user input, and straight up missing user input.To a much lesser extent, this is also true of the output of an LLM. Oftentimes the output of an LLM is technically a string but that string may contain some structure (json, yaml) that is intended to be parsed into a structured representation. Understanding what the exact output is can help determine if there may be a need for different parsing.LangSmith provides a straightforward visualization of the exact inputs/outputs to all LLM calls, so you can easily understand them.If I edit the prompt, how does that affect the output?\\u200bSo you notice a bad output, and you go into LangSmith to see what's going on. You find the faulty LLM call and are now looking at the exact input. You want to try changing a word or a phrase to see what happens -- what do you do?We constantly ran into this issue. Initially, we copied the prompt to a playground of sorts. But this got annoying, so we built a playground of our own! When examining an LLM call, you can click the Open in Playground button to access this playground. Here, you can modify the prompt and re-run it to observe the resulting changes to the output - as many times as needed!Currently, this feature supports only OpenAI and Anthropic models and works for LLM and Chat Model calls.

LangSmith can also be used to monitor your application in much the same way that you used for debugging. You can log all traces, visualize latency and token usage statistics, and troubleshoot specific issues as they arise. Each run can also be assigned string tags or key-value metadata, allowing you to attach correlation ids or AB test variants, and filter runs accordingly.We’ve also made it possible to associate feedback programmatically with runs. This means that if your application has a thumbs up/down button on it, you can use that to log feedback back to LangSmith. This can be used to track performance over time and pinpoint under performing data points, which you can subsequently add to a dataset for future testing — mirroring the debug mode approach.We’ve provided several examples in the LangSmith documentation for extracting insights from logged runs. In addition to guiding you on performing this task yourself, we also provide examples of integrating with third parties for this purpose. We're eager to expand this area in the coming months! If you have ideas for either -- an open-source way to evaluate, or are building a company that wants to do analytics over these runs, please reach out.Exporting datasets\\u200bLangSmith makes it easy to curate datasets. However, these aren’t just useful inside LangSmith; they can be exported for use in other contexts. Notable applications include exporting for use in OpenAI Evals or fine-tuning, such as with FireworksAI.To set up tracing in Deno, web browsers, or other runtime environments without access to the environment, check out the FAQs.↩PreviousLangSmithNextTracingOn by defaultDebuggingWhat was the exact input to the LLM?If I edit the prompt, how does that affect the output?What is the exact sequence of events?Why did my chain take much longer than expected?How many tokens were used?Collaborative debuggingCollecting examplesTesting & evaluationHuman EvaluationMonitoringExporting datasetsCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubDocs CodeLangSmith SDKPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogCopyright © 2024 LangChain, Inc.\", metadata={'source': 'https://docs.smith.langchain.com/overview', 'title': 'LangSmith Overview and User Guide | 🦜️🛠️ LangSmith', 'description': 'Building reliable LLM applications can be challenging.

We can use a dataset\\nthat we’ve constructed along the way (see above). Alternatively, we could spend some\\ntime constructing a small dataset by hand. For these situations, LangSmith simplifies\\ndataset uploading.Once we have a dataset, how can we use it to test changes to a prompt or chain? The most basic approach is to run the chain over the data points and visualize the outputs. Despite technological advancements, there still is no substitute for looking at outputs by eye. Currently, running the chain over the data points needs to be done client-side. The LangSmith client makes it easy to pull down a dataset and then run a chain over them, logging the results to a new project associated with the dataset. From there, you can review them. We\\'ve made it easy to assign feedback to runs and mark them as correct or incorrect directly in the web app, displaying aggregate statistics for each test project.We also make it easier to evaluate these runs. To that end, we\\'ve added a set of evaluators to the open-source LangChain library. These evaluators can be specified when initiating a test run and will evaluate the results once the test run completes. If we’re being honest, most of these evaluators aren\\'t perfect. We would not recommend that you trust them blindly. However, we do think they are useful for guiding your eye to examples you should look at. This becomes especially valuable as the number of data points increases and it becomes infeasible to look at each one manually.Human Evaluation\\u200bAutomatic evaluation metrics are helpful for getting consistent and scalable information about model behavior;\\nhowever, there is still no complete substitute for human review to get the utmost quality and reliability from your application.\\nLangSmith makes it easy to manually review and annotate runs through annotation queues.These queues allow you to select any runs based on criteria like model type or automatic evaluation scores, and queue them up for human review. As a reviewer, you can then quickly step through the runs, viewing the input, output, and any existing tags before adding your own feedback.We often use this for a couple of reasons:To assess subjective qualities that automatic evaluators struggle with, like creativity or humorTo sample and validate a subset of runs that were auto-evaluated, ensuring the automatic metrics are still reliable and capturing the right informationAll the annotations made using the queue are assigned as \"feedback\" to the source runs, so you can easily filter and analyze them later.', metadata={'source': 'https://docs.smith.langchain.com/overview', 'title': 'LangSmith Overview and User Guide | 🦜️🛠️ LangSmith', 'description': 'Building reliable LLM applications can be challenging.

LangSmith can also be used to monitor your application in much the same way that you used for debugging. You can log all traces, visualize latency and token usage statistics, and troubleshoot specific issues as they arise. Each run can also be assigned string tags or key-value metadata, allowing you to attach correlation ids or AB test variants, and filter runs accordingly.We’ve also made it possible to associate feedback programmatically with runs. This means that if your application has a thumbs up/down button on it, you can use that to log feedback back to LangSmith. This can be used to track performance over time and pinpoint under performing data points, which you can subsequently add to a dataset for future testing — mirroring the debug mode approach.We’ve provided several examples in the LangSmith documentation for extracting insights from logged runs. In addition to guiding you on performing this task yourself, we also provide examples of integrating with third parties for this purpose. We're eager to expand this area in the coming months! If you have ideas for either -- an open-source way to evaluate, or are building a company that wants to do analytics over these runs, please reach out.Exporting datasets\\u200bLangSmith makes it easy to curate datasets. However, these aren’t just useful inside LangSmith; they can be exported for use in other contexts. Notable applications include exporting for use in OpenAI Evals or fine-tuning, such as with FireworksAI.To set up tracing in Deno, web browsers, or other runtime environments without access to the environment, check out the FAQs.↩PreviousLangSmithNextTracingOn by defaultDebuggingWhat was the exact input to the LLM?If I edit the prompt, how does that affect the output?What is the exact sequence of events?Why did my chain take much longer than expected?How many tokens were used?Collaborative debuggingCollecting examplesTesting & evaluationHuman EvaluationMonitoringExporting datasetsCommunityDiscordTwitterGitHubDocs CodeLangSmith SDKPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogCopyright © 2024 LangChain, Inc.\", metadata={'source': 'https://docs.smith.langchain.com/overview', 'title': 'LangSmith Overview and User Guide | 🦜️🛠️ LangSmith', 'description': 'Building reliable LLM applications can be challenging.

       "  Document(page_content='inputs, and see what happens. At some point though, our application is performing\\nwell and we want to be more rigorous about testing changes. We can use a dataset\\nthat we’ve constructed along the way (see above). Alternatively, we could spend some\\ntime constructing a small dataset by hand. For these situations, LangSmith simplifies\\ndataset uploading.Once we have a dataset, how can we use it to test changes to a prompt or chain? The most basic approach is to run the chain over the data points and visualize the outputs. Despite technological advancements, there still is no substitute for looking at outputs by eye. Currently, running the chain over the data points needs to be done client-side. The LangSmith client makes it easy to pull down a dataset and then run a chain over them, logging the results to a new project associated with the dataset. From there, you can review them. We\\'ve made it easy to assign feedback to runs and mark them as correct or incorrect directly in the web app, displaying aggregate statistics for each test project.We also make it easier to evaluate these runs. To that end, we\\'ve added a set of evaluators to the open-source LangChain library. These evaluators can be specified when initiating a test run and will evaluate the results once the test run completes. If we’re being honest, most of these evaluators aren\\'t perfect. We would not recommend that you trust them blindly. However, we do think they are useful for guiding your eye to examples you should look at. This becomes especially valuable as the number of data points increases and it becomes infeasible to look at each one manually.Human Evaluation\\u200bAutomatic evaluation metrics are helpful for getting consistent and scalable information about model behavior;\\nhowever, there is still no complete substitute for human review to get the utmost quality and reliability from your application.\\nLangSmith makes it easy to manually review and annotate runs through annotation queues.These queues allow you to select any runs based on criteria like model type or automatic evaluation scores, and queue them up for human review. As a reviewer, you can then quickly step through the runs, viewing the input, output, and any existing tags before adding your own feedback.We often use this for a couple of reasons:To assess subjective qualities that automatic evaluators struggle with, like creativity or humorTo sample and validate a subset of runs that were auto-evaluated, ensuring the automatic metrics are still reliable and capturing the right informationAll the annotations made using the queue are assigned as \"feedback\" to the source runs, so you can easily filter and analyze them later.', metadata={'source': 'https://docs.smith.langchain.com/overview', 'title': 'LangSmith Overview and User Guide | 🦜️🛠️ LangSmith', 'description': 'Building reliable LLM applications can be challenging.

       " 'answer': 'LangSmith can help test your LLM applications in several ways. Here are a few ways LangSmith can assist with testing:\\n\\n1. Debugging: LangSmith provides visibility into the exact input and output of LLM calls, helping you understand the inputs and outputs of your LLM applications. This can be particularly useful for identifying bugs in formatting logic, unexpected transformations, or missing user input.\\n\\n2. Editing Prompts: If you want to test how changes to the prompt affect the output, LangSmith offers a playground feature. You can modify the prompt and re-run it multiple times to observe the resulting changes to the output. This feature currently supports OpenAI and Anthropic models for LLM and Chat Model calls.\\n\\n3. Sequence of Events: For complex chains and agents, it can be challenging to understand the sequence of events. LangSmith helps by providing insights into the calls being made and their order, enabling you to analyze and troubleshoot the behavior of your application.\\n\\n4. Dataset Testing: LangSmith simplifies dataset uploading and allows you to test changes to prompts or chains using the dataset. You can run the chain over the data points, visualize the outputs, and log the results to a new project associated with the dataset. LangSmith also provides evaluators to help guide your evaluation of the results.\\n\\n5. Human Evaluation: While automatic evaluation metrics are useful, human review is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of your application. LangSmith offers annotation queues that allow you to manually review and annotate runs. This is helpful for assessing subjective qualities, validating auto-evaluated runs, and capturing feedback for further analysis.\\n\\nIn addition to testing, LangSmith also provides monitoring capabilities, dataset exporting, and integration with third-party tools for analytics and insights.'}"
